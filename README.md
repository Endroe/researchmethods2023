Project Outline:

General Information
This project aims to investigate whether the use of correct capitalisation in Twitter messages has decreased over the past decade due to an increase in informal communication styles among Twitter users.

Background Information
Previous studies have suggested that social media has had a significant impact on language use and grammar skills among users. For example, studies by Danet (2001) and Crystal (2006) have found that social media platforms such as Twitter have led to the development of new communication styles that are more informal and abbreviated than traditional written language.

Research Question and Hypotheses
Research Question: Does the use of correct capitalisation in Twitter messages decrease over the past decade due to an increase in informal communication styles among Twitter users?

Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the use of correct capitalisation in Twitter messages has decreased over the past decade due to an increase in informal communication styles among Twitter users.

Method
To investigate our research question and test our hypothesis, we will conduct a quantitative analysis of a dataset of Twitter messages. We will use a random sampling method to ensure that our dataset is representative of Twitter users. We will analyze the frequency of correct capitalization in Twitter messages over the past decade and examine any trends or patterns in its use.
