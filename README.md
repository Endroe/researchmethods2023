## Abstract
This research paper investigates whether
the use of correct capitalisation and punc-
tuation on Twitter has increased over the
past decade due to the growth of infor-
mal communication styles among Twit-
ter users. The study uses a dataset of
6,383,732 Dutch tweets extracted from the
twitter2 corpus and employs a regex pat-
tern matching technique to analyze the
data. The results suggest that there has
been a stark increase in the use of correct
capitalisation and punctuation in Twitter
messages over the past decade, likely due
to improved writing skills, increased use
of automated tools, and a greater emphasis
on the importance of proper grammar and
punctuation. The findings have implica-
tions for language use and grammar skills
among Twitter users, as well as for social
media marketing
